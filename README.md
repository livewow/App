Database is set up and we can successfully connect to it, the difficulty is that read/write
actions based on authenticated users. Please make sure not to commit the google-services.json
file, it contains private API keys and should not be in the repository, if you need them
contact me and I will get them to you. Along those lines, any additional API keys we use
should not be commited to the repo.
